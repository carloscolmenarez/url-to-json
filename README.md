# URL Query and JSON Web Tool

## Description
This web tool simplifies the process of working with URLs and their query parameters. It offers two functionalities: extracting query parameters from URLs and converting them into JSON format, and the reverse process of generating URLs with query parameters from JSON input. Designed for developers, testers, and anyone working with web applications and APIs, this tool facilitates the manipulation and analysis of URL parameters and JSON data.
This tool was developed in less than 2 hours using ChatGPT.
